        <h1 class="font">Asus ROG Phone 5 Review: A Gaming PowerHouse</h1>

            <h2>Asus ROG Phone 5 Intro</h2>
            <p>The Asus ROG Phone 5 manages to improve upon last year's already impressive ROG Phone 3 with even better stereo speakers, better battery life, and the world's lowest touch latency on a phone display.</p>
            <p>It is arguably the coolest phone to get if you wish to stand out from a crowd of Samsung and Apple users, or you simply enjoy having full control over every aspect of your device – from screen refresh rate and audio tuning to GPU and CPU clock speeds.</p>
            <p>And if you're heavy into mobile gaming – the ROG 5 is pretty much the only phone to get in 2021 for its performance, accessory support, AirTriggers and gaming-dedicated software.</p>
            <p>The ROG Phone 5 will be launching this month in all of the regions its predecessor was available in. In Europe, the phone's starting price will be 799 EUR, but we're yet to know prices for other regions like North America, China and India. The exact availability dates are also yet to be announced by Asus.</p>
            <h2 class="title2">Asus ROG Phone 5 Design</h2>
            <img src="Images/AsusROG5Design.jpeg" alt="">
            <p>Over last year's ROG Phone 3, the Asus ROG Phone 5 has gotten a bit more narrow and tall, like most modern flagship phones. It feels great in the hand, with a good heft to it, thanks to the large battery inside.</p>
            <p>The front has small top and bottom bezels, which house arguably the best speakers ever put on a smartphone, along with the selfie camera, earpiece and a welcome notification light. Under the Gorilla Glass Victus-covered display is the phone's optical fingerprint scanner, which is fast and reliable.</p>
            <p>The Asus ROG Phone 5's metal frame holds the usual volume rockers and power key on the right side. The same side also has two AirTriggers, which are touch-sensitive areas that functionally resemble shoulder buttons on a gamepad. On the left side of the phone, we have a special connector for ROG Phone gaming accessories, such as the AeroActive Cooler 5.</p>
            <p>But the real show is on the back, where we have a dot matrix style light-up ROG logo, which can be customized to cycle between colors, flash or show a color of your choosing. Even if you disable its lights, the ROG logo is visible, giving this phone quite a distinguishing look.</p>
            <p>In addition, the phone's Gorilla Glass 3-covered back has a few red accents, such as small "Republic of Gamers" text, but the overall design isn't as obnoxious as gaming phones of the past. It's well acceptable to be a daily driver even if you're not a gamer.</p>
            <p>A gripe I had about this phone's predecessor is that the glass back was slippery, causing it to slide off smooth surfaces rather easily, and sadly, the ROG Phone 5's back is similar in that regard. You'll need to be mindful where you place it to charge, as it might be on the ground by the time you return.</p>
            <h2 class="title2">Asus ROG Phone 5 Display</h2>
            <img src="Images/AsusROG5Display.jpeg" alt="">
            <p>The Asus ROG Phone 5 sports a gorgeous 6.78-inch AMOLED display with a resolution of 2448x1080. Its refresh rate can go up to 144 Hz for a super-smooth experience, or down to the more common 60 Hz, if you'd rather save on battery life.</p>
            <p>The display is HDR10+ certified, which means improved color and contrast for when watching movies, and it boasts the world's lowest touch latency response on a phone, at 24.3 milliseconds. The latter suggests that the ROG Phone 5 will react faster than any other current smartphone to your gaming inputs, which can prove invaluable to hardcore or even professional gamers. However, it's not something you'll be able to notice in day-to-day usage.</p>
            <p>Aside from having great colors, as AMOLED displays tend to do, the Asus ROG Phone 5's screen can also get really bright, but perhaps more importantly – reasonably dim. I wasn't happy with the minimum brightness of last year's ROG Phone 3, as the screen was still too bright for nighttime use. Thankfully, Asus has improved the minimum brightness on the ROG 5, so it's now easier on the eyes when watching a show before bed.</p>
            <p>Like most other things about the Asus ROG Phone 5, which we'll get into, the display can be tuned to your liking. It has a few presets, such as "Natural" and "Cinematic", but you can also adjust the color temperature manually if you just want slightly warmer colors, for example. There's also a "Night Light" option for reducing the display's blue tones, which is presumably easier on the eyes at night.</p>
            <p>The Asus ROG Phone 5 also has an always-on display option (called Always-on Panel). When enabled, the phone will show the time, date, battery percentage and notification icons on the screen when it's locked. However, this will have an impact on the battery life. We did notice that the ROG 5's display is a lower-quality one as compared to the likes of even the OnePlus Nord when it comes to viewing angles. Colors can shift a bit and it loses on some brightness under an angle, although it's not too noticeable. We have the display measurements results below.</p>
            <h2 class="title2">Asus ROG Phone 5 Gaming Performance</h2>
            <img src="Images/AsusROG5GamingPerformance.jpeg" alt="">
            <p>The Asus ROG Phone 5 comes with Android 11 and ZenUI on top. Like previously mentioned, the phone offers plenty of customizability, and for gaming in particular – the one feature that stands out is X Mode.</p>
            <p>X Mode gives the user control over the ROG Phone 5's CPU and GPU speeds, RAM performance, temperature control, display refresh rate, touch sensitivity and more. Through X Mode, hardcore mobile gamers can tune the Asus ROG Phone 5 to their liking, similarly to how hardcore PC gamers often delve into overclocking or underclocking their rigs.</p>
            <p>And while X Mode might sound overwhelming, it's not. The app is easy to use and straightforward, plus you're not actually required to use it at all. But even casual mobile gamers will find fun and useful settings to play around with within X Mode.For example – editing how the dot matrix-style ROG logo on the back of the phone behaves, or changing its color to your favorite one, which adds a personal touch to the Asus ROG Phone 5, making it your own.</p>
            <p>With or without X Mode, gaming on this phone is a blast. You have two fantastic stereo speakers facing you, so you hear perfectly where each in-game explosion and gunshot are coming from. The beautiful AMOLED screen can go up to 144 Hz for a super-smooth gaming experience, which complements the ROG Phone 5's blazing fast performance. But perhaps most notably, you have two AirTriggers, one on each side of the phone when holding it in landscape mode. Asus describes AirTriggers as "invisible ultrasonic buttons" and "motion sensor triggers".</p>
            <h2 class="title2">Asus ROG Phone 5 Battery Life</h2>
            <img src="Images/AsusROG5Battery.jpeg" alt="">
            <p>The Asus ROG Phone 5 has dual 3000 mAh batteries and as can be expected from a total of 6000 mAh – the battery life of this phone is very impressive.</p>
            <p>In our testing, with its display set to 60 Hz, the Asus ROG Phone 5 lasted 13 hours and 17 minutes of web browsing, 10 hours and 8 minutes of 3D gaming and just over 13 hours of YouTube playback on a single charge. Of course, those numbers will be smaller if the display is set to its maximum of 144 Hz.</p>
            <p>And in times when some manufacturers won't even give you a charging brick out the box, citing environmental reasons, the ROG Phone 5 comes with a solid 65W charger. It's a bit large, but it has a nice, premium-feeling braided cable and can fast-charge the phone from 0% to 70% in just about 30 minutes.</p>
            <p>In our charging test, the ROG Phone 5 indeed proved to charge impressively fast, going from zero to 100% in just 57 minutes, which is significantly faster than high-profile flagships like the Galaxy S21 Ultra and iPhone 11 Pro Max. The ROG Phone 5's charging speeds also beat its own predecessor, which took 103 minutes to fully charge in our testing.</p>
