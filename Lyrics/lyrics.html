    <b>… Once upon a younger year</b>
    When all our shadows disappeared        
    The animals inside came out to play
    Went face to face with all our fears
    Learned our lessons through the tears
    Made memories we knew would never fade

    <b>… One day, my father, he told me, "Son, don't let it slip away"</b>
    He took me in his arms, I heard him say
    "When you get older your wild heart will live for younger days
    Think of me if ever you're afraid"

    <b>… He said, "One day, you'll leave this world behind</b>
    So live a life you will remember"
    My father told me when I was just a child
    "These are the nights that never die"
    My father told me

    <b>… "When thunderclouds start pouring down</b>
    Light a fire they can't put out
    Carve your name into those shining stars"
    He said, "Go venture far beyond the shores
    Don't forsake this life of yours
    I'll guide you home no matter where you are"

    <b>… One day, my father, he told me, "Son, don't let it slip away"</b>
    When I was just a kid, I heard him say
    "When you get older your wild heart will live for younger days
    Think of me if ever you're afraid"

    <b>… He said, "One day, you'll leave this world behind</b>
    So live a life you will remember"
    My father told me when I was just a child
    "These are the nights that never die"
    My father told me

    <b>… "These are the nights that never die"</b>
    My father told me

    <b>… My father told me</b>
