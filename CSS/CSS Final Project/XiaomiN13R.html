            <h2>Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 5G Intro</h2>
            <p>Redmi phones are known for their great value, and we have not one, but five of value-driven new Redmi Note 13 series devices to start the year 2024.</p>
            <p>This particular review is for the Redmi Note 13 5G, one of the more affordable phones in the bunch at a price of 300 euro. Like all the rest in the family, it features a 6.7-inch display and you should also know that the Note 13 5G is a substantial upgrade over the 4G Redmi Note 13 version.</p>
            <h2 class="title2">Redmi Note 13 5G Design</h2>
            <img src="Images/XiaomiN13Design.jpeg" alt="">
            <p>The Redmi Note 13 5G steps up the design compared to the vanilla non-5G version, but the size at 6.7 inches is just as big as all other phones in the Note 13 series.</p>
            <p>It is solidly put together, the cameras are arranged a bit more neatly and the white color that we have for this review looks particularly good.</p>
            <p>Power and volume buttons are on the right, the left side is clean, on the bottom you have a USB-C port and the speaker, and on top you get a 3.5mm headphone jack, as well as an IR blaster.</p>
            <h2 class="title2">Redmi Note 13 5G Unboxing</h2>
            <img src="Images/RedmiN13Unboxing.jpeg" alt="">
            <p>Here is what you can find in the box:
                <ul>
                    <li>Redmi Note 13 5G phone with pre-applied plastic screen protector</li>
                    <li>33W charging brick with USB-A output</li>
                    <li>Charging cable (USB-A to USB-C)</li>
                    <li>Silicone case</li>
                    <li>SIM tool</li>
                    <li>User manuals</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Having a free case and a pre-applied screen protector are two things you don't get on flagship phones, but that is the beauty of buying an affordable Redmi phone. It's all included in the box!</p>
            <h2 class="title2">Redmi Note 13 5G Display</h2>
            <img src="Images/RedmiN13Display.jpeg" alt="">
            <p>Unlike the the non-5G version, this here phone comes with slim borders around the screen and a modern look.</p>
            <p>The 6.7-inch screen size remains, and it features a 1080p resolution and 120Hz refresh rate. The screen uses the newer Gorilla Glass 5 for protection, but interestingly, compared to the non-5G model, it reaches a lower peak brightness of 1,000 nits.</p>
            <p>Below, you can find our own lab measurements of the Redmi Note 13 5G.</p>
            <p>It's impressive how this budget phone can hit more than 1,000 nits of brightness and it can get quite dim at night too for comfortable bedtime use.</p>
            <p>Interestingly, the Redmi Note 13 5G is the only phone in the series to come with a side positioned fingerprint scanner, embedded in the power button. This is a bit faster and more accurate than an in-screen fingerprint reader, but the position might be a bit less convenient for some.</p>
            <h2 class="title2">Redmi Note 13 5G Camera</h2>
            <img src="Images/RedmiN13Camer.jpeg" alt="">
            <p>The 108-megapixel f/1.7 main camera is the big highlight here and you also have an 8MP ultra-wide camera. The third lens located above the LED flash is a quite useless, low-resolution 2MP macro camera.</p>
            <p>While you don't have a dedicated telephoto camera, thanks to the large sensor, Xiaomi says you have 3X "lossless" zoom.</p>
            <p>Video recording is limited to a 1080p resolution, so no 4K here and detail is definitely not very plentiful.However, the good thing is that video stabilization works quite decently, a big upgrade over the shaky and barely usable footage out of the Redmi Note 13 4G edition.</p>
            <p>Some limitations, however, should be noted: once you start recording with the main camera, you cannot switch to the ultra-wide camera (if you want to use that camera, you have to first switch to it BEFORE hitting the record button). You do have zoom and it works quite smoothly, but it is digital and the quality is just as you'd expect: quite bad.</p>
            <h2 class="title2">Redmi Note 13 5G Software</h2>
            <img src="Images/RedmiN13Software.jpeg" alt="">
            <p>When we talk about Xiaomi / Redmi phones software, we always start with a warning: these phones are killing background apps very aggressively, which leads to a well known problem with push notifications. Some apps just will not show notifications in time, even if you try and tweak all available settings in MIUI, and if you rely on these notifications this can be a dealbreaker.</p>
            <p>With that cleared out of the way, we should say that the Redmi Note 13 5G comes with Android 13 and MIUI 14 on top of it.MIUI 14 has generously drawn inspiration from iOS, but its main advantage is that it runs smoothly and is well refined when it comes to animation and transition speeds. Unfortunately, you do not get the latest HyperOS software here.</p>
            <p>Same with haptics — the iPhones' Taptic engine has been incredible since inception. Precise and pleasing clicks with every interface interaction. But Android land has caught up, and Samsung's vibration is almost as good — it's sometimes weirdly delayed, or not as pronounced. But that's nitpicking from a person who has to use them both and look hard for those nits.</p>
            <h2 class="title2">Redmi Note 13 5G Battery and Charging Speed</h2>
            <p>Like the rest of the series, you have a 5,000mAh battery on board with the Redmi Note 13 5G, a solid size.The frugal MIUI software helps make the best of it too.And below, you can find how this phone scored on our independent battery tests.</p>
            <p>On our lightest web browsing test, the Redmi Note 13 5G scores around 12 hours with some change, a mediocre result. However, in the YouTube video streaming test, the Redmi does better with a respectable result of 10 hours and 18 minutes.</p>
            <h2 class="title2">Summary</h2>
            <img src="Images/RedmiN13Final.jpeg" alt="">
            <p>When you draw the bottom line, the Redmi Note 13 5G comes up as a well balanced phone with solid performance, decent camera quality and very good battery life, all at a reasonable price.</p>
            <p>The quirky MIUI software, however, seems like the big stumbling block, and we specifically mean the way it kills background apps and fails to deliver push notifications on time for some apps. This issue has been around for nearly a decade, and we have no idea why it's not fixed yet.</p>
            <p>If you can live with that, the Redmi Note 13 5G seems like a pretty good choice.</p>
