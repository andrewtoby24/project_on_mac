            <h2>Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra Intro</h2>
            <p>The brand-new S Pen-armed Galaxy S24 Ultra launched right at the end of January — about 11 months after the release of the old Galaxy S23 series. Couldn't even wait the full year! It is now available and you can shop for a Galaxy S24 Ultra deal at will.</p>
            <p>What has changed? There's a new processor — that's a given. There are also some minor design facelifts, but more importantly, we have a titanium-coated frame to keep up with the times. The camera module looks similar, but the zoom cameras' specs changed up a bit. We still have 4 total cameras, but instead of a 10x lens, we now have a 5x lens that does some really good digital zooming to compensate (thanks to a higher-res sensor).</p>
            <p>And, we now get to see the Galaxy S24 Ultra go completely flat-screened. Samsung has been reducing the edge curve over the past few years. If you are still a fan of it, it looks like the Galaxy S23 Ultra may be your last chance to get a phone with an Edge screen for a while. The good news is that we do expect Samsung to keep selling the S23 Ultra as a "reduced cost model" over the next year.</p>
            <p>But back to present times, Samsung has launched a trio of Galaxy S24 devices. We have separate Galaxy S24 review and Galaxy S24 Plus review up, but if you want to go all out overkill with Samsung's top tier tech — here is the Galaxy S24 Ultra:</p>
            <h2 class="title2">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra Design</h2>
            <img src="Images/S24UDesign.jpg" alt="">
            <p>All hail Titanius — the new ruler of the flagship phones. Joking aside, we have a titanium frame on the Galaxy S24 Ultra now, following in the footsteps of Apple's Pro iPhones. It's a soft touch matte and it looks clean and stylish — pretty cool. We don't get a lot of benefits in terms of weight — it's about the same as before since the titanium is replacing an aluminum frame from before. (Unlike with the iPhone 15 Pro, where it replaced a heavy stainless steel frame).</p>
            <p>Samsung also completely removed the curvature of the screen. The soft Edge design has been getting less and less prominent over the years, as it appears consumers simply prefer a flat display. And Samsung has been obliging, slowly but surely pushing the curve closer and closer to the edge of the screen, until it finally disappears. Each year, it has been getting good feedback from the community — it seems that smartphone users are generally over the "futuristic" look of curved glass screens. On the Galaxy S24 Ultra, the curve is so slight, it's barely there — and it's a part of the phone's bezel, so it does not cut into the display, not one bit.</p>
            <p>The frame rounds off, but has a nice flat area, and the matter titanium is just the right grain — it feels grippy and secure. Still, rocking one of these jewels naked would be an adventurous decision. Make sure you check out our Galaxy S24 size comparison, so you'd know what you're getting yourself into. The titanium may be tough, but it'd be a good idea to shop around for some Galaxy S24 Ultra cases as well. </p>
            <h2 class="title2">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra Display</h2>
            <img src="Images/S24UDisplay.jpg" alt="">
            <p>As before, we have a 6.8-inch, Dynamic AMOLED 2x screen — Samsung's best screen tech that has been awesome for years now. There's more brightness headroom, with a peak brightness of 2,600 nits — that only matters when watching HDR content and under very bright conditions. But hey, it's there.</p>
            <p>It's still QHD+ resolution for super crisp images, and it's still an LTPO panel with variation between 1 Hz and 120 Hz — Samsung has been doing that with the Ultra models for a while now.</p>
            <p>Colors look beautiful, and you again have a choice between an amped up mode, and a more natural "Basic" mode. Plus the adaptive eye protection, which filters out blue light depending on time of day and ambient lighting. Samsung screens are easy on the eye and great to look at.</p>
            <p>We, again, have an ultrasonic fingerprint scanner under the glass. It's fast and accurate, and ultrasonic tech is typically better than the optic sensor that most other manufacturers use — it's supposedly more secure, but what we do know for a fact is that it can read your print better if you hand is moist, or there's some smudging on your finger or on the glass.</p>
            <h2 class="title2">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra Camera</h2>
            <img src="Images/S24UCamera.jpg" alt="">
            <p>The Galaxy S24 camera has always been among the leaders of the pack. OK, we are back to having a 200 MP main camera, a 12 MP ultra-wide camera, and then two zoom cameras — a 10 MP zoom camera with a 3x telephoto lens, and a 50 MP one with a 5x lens. You may have noticed — the 5x camera replaced the 10x lens of yesteryear. Apparently, Samsung is using the high-res 50 MP sensor and some AI trickery to achieve the same, or better, results with it.</p>
            <p>Off the main camera, we get great results. It seems the typical Samsung-isms of having too much grean in the grass, and neon blue skies have been toned down quite a lot. The colors are vibrant and saturated, but we wouldn't say unrealistic. The photos come out with good exposure and dynamics balance. You can spot some sharpening around tree branches, but it's not too excessive, we find. At least not in the current smartphone camera climate where everyone seems to sharpen details for that wow effect.</p> 
            <h2 class="title2">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra Performance</h2>
            <p>The Galaxy S24 Ultra has the brand-new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 Mobile Platform for Galaxy. Again, it's like a normal Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, slightly overclocked for Samsung flagships.</p>
            <p>For what it is, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 is an extremely powerful processor — no doubt one that enables the AI trickery that the S24 can do with pictures and live translations. It scores high in the benchmarks, naturally. And, more importantly, the phone feels pretty quick in daily use. Now, when editing photos with the generative AI editor — it does take its sweet time. But that's still new tech, so it's to be expected. It just shows us how long it's been since we've had a major new development on smartphones, that we are used to everything being quick and polished.</p>
            <h2 class="title2">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra OS</h2>
            <img src="Images/S24UOS.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Naturally, the S24 Ultra launches with Android 14, with Samsung's One UI 6.1 reskinning the operating system to an unrecognizable level. Not to say that's bad — One UI has grown and evolved over the years to not only be feature-packed, but also user friendly. So long as the user does spend some time with the phone — there are quite a lot of things to do with it!</p>
            <p>Like split-screen scenes, which you can save and recall at any time, floating your apps in resizable windows, taking long screenshots or noting on your screenshots with the S Pen.</p>
            <p>Ah yes, the S Pen suite comes with even more features, like controlling the phone with air gestures from the stylus, using it as a mouse cursor when hovering, and — of course — writing and drawing.</p>
            <p>We are curious to see if these AI features will expand throughout the year, and if they will trickle down to older Galaxy phones.</p>
            <h2 class="title2">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra Battery</h2>
            <img src="Images/S24UBattery.jpg" alt="">
            <p>The Galaxy S24 Ultra battery has the same 5,000 mAh capacity as before. It has a pretty good endurance — in fact, about the same as the Galaxy S23 Ultra. </p>
            <p>OK, what does that say about real-life use? Well, the Galaxy S24 Ultra isn't quite a "2-day phone", especially if you spend a lot of time enjoying those new AI features. But it can very comfortably last you a day and then some. If you are a more casual user, it can take it up to the second evening before requiring a charge, sure.</p>
            <p>It also won't be pushing any charge speed limits, with wired charging at 45 W, and wireless — 15 W. No Qi2 support, too, which we were kind of hoping for.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, the phone does not come with a charger in the box. We figure that, in 2024, there's a high chance that you have a power brick that's capable of delivering that optimal 45 W over a USB C cable. Just be warned that, if you don't, you will probably get slower charging speeds.</p>
            <p>Typical Qi charging speeds — 15 W, pretty much any modern pad supports this. There are still some old ones with 7.5 W floating about, so — again — your results might differ.</p>
            <h2 class="title2">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Bottom line, the Galaxy S24 Ultra is a very, very good phone with powerful hardware, good camera, and dependable battery. Plus, it now has that 7 year software upgrade promise, so it's really easy to recommend it, even at its high entry price. If you are still looking to save an extra buck, we wouldn't say that the Galaxy S23 Ultra is out of the picture yet. In fact, S23 Ultra owners probably can stave off the "upgrade crave" for now. You will miss out on some new AI features, but then again — these are only now coming in, there will be more meaningful upgrades to look forward to in the near future.</p>
