            <h2>Android vs iOS: Which Ecosystem Wins?</h2>
            <p>In mid-2024, flagship phone enjoyers have really two options to consider: the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max. Both the new Galaxy and iPhone 15 Pro Max feature large screens, the fastest chipsets available right now, enhanced camera systems, and all the battery life you might need.</p>
            <p>What is truly new, however, is Samsung beating Apple in the AI game with a bunch of new "Galaxy AI" features. Add a brand-new zoom camera with plenty of AI tricks of its own, and the iPhone has some serious competition!</p>
            <p>However, Apple's most advanced phone ever also has a ton of advantages, namely the faster performance thanks to the 3nm chip, as well as the better battery life in video and gaming. Let's first outline the major differences between the two:</p>

            </div>
            <h2 class="title2">Design and Size</h2>
            <img src="Images/S24vs15promax_display_comp.jpeg" alt="">
            <p>When it comes to design and styling, the Galaxy and iPhone each come with their own distinct style.The Galaxy has the bigger footprint: the phone is wider, it weighs more (233 grams vs 221 grams), and it has these sharp corners. The iPhone 15 Pro Max, on the other hand, has a more traditional look with rounded corners. </p>
            <p>When it comes to buttons, the power and volume keys are all on one side on the Galaxy, while on the iPhone the power button is on the right, while the volume keys are on the left, which makes it a bit easier to press these together to take a screenshot, for example.The iPhone also features one extra button: the new Action button. The idea is great, it's a button that you can set to what you want, but we don't like the placement as it's in the far top-left corner, so slightly unreachable.</p>
            <p>Oh, and you finally have USB-C on the iPhone, just like the Galaxy has had for… the last decade or so! But hey, better late than never, and at least you can now use one cable on all your devices.Of course, you also have the S Pen tucked inside the Galaxy, and it remains the only phone with this cool stylus inside it. There are no changes to the functionality of the S Pen this year, but it's still just as useful as before.</p>
            <p>Both phones are also IP68 rated, just like pretty much all other flagships, so you get excellent water and dust protection.When it comes to colors, here are the color options for the Galaxy S24 Ultra and iPhone 15 Pro Max. </p>
            <h2 class="title2">Display Differences</h2>
            <img src="Images/S24vs15promax_design_comp.jpeg" alt="">
            <p>The wider size of the Galaxy allows for a larger screen too: you get a 6.8-inch screen compared to a 6.7-inch display on the iPhone 15 Pro Max. But not only that, the screen has a wider 19:3:9 aspect ratio (the iPhone has a 19.5:9), so the actual screen area on the Galaxy is even bigger than the display diagonal numbers alone suggest.</p>
            <p>The new thing with the Galaxy is that it uses a flat screen now with only the glass ever so slightly curved at the edges, and the iPhone also uses a flat screen. We find this change for the better.</p>
            <p>One area where the Galaxy literally outshines the iPhone is screen brightness. The S24 Ultra can hit 2,600 nits peak brightness, while the iPhone reaches 2,000 nits. Those "peak" figures are achieved when you have a tiny white spot on an all-black background. In our measurements where we test an all-white screen, the Galaxy hits 1,280 nits of brightness, beating the 1,092 nits of the iPhone 15 Pro Max. That's particularly useful outdoors on a sunny day, but the bigger difference is just how few reflections you get on the Galaxy screen. This is thanks to the new Gorilla Glass Armor, and it almost feels like a matte screen, it's a huge difference that makes using the Galaxy so much easier outdoors.</p>
            <p>In terms of resolution, the Galaxy is a bit sharper with a 1440p screen compared to the 1290p screen on the iPhone.Both also support 120Hz adaptive refresh rate, and can go down to just 1Hz with statics content.As for biometrics, the Galaxy relies on an upgraded in-screen fingerprint scanner of the ultrasonic kind, which is slightly faster than in previous generations. Additionally, you also have image-based face recognition too. On the iPhone, you only have Face ID, which uses a 3D model of your face. Both a fingerprint and face recognition are nice to have, and it really depends on personal preference which one you use.</p>
            <h2 class="title2">Camera Differences</h2>
            <img src="Images/S24vs15promax_camera_comp.jpeg" alt="">
            <p>The Galaxy S24 Ultra sticks with four cameras on the back, but makes some significant changes to one of them, while the iPhone 15 Pro Max features three cameras on the back including the new 5X tetraprism zoom lens.</p>
            <p>Firstly, despite a 200MP main sensor, the Galaxy S24 Ultra still defaults to 12MP shots, while the iPhone 15 Pro Max now captures 24MP photos, so it has slightly more detail.What is new is Samsung making significant changes to image processing. Galaxy S24 photos no longer have the excessive oversharpening of its predecessor and are now a much closer match to the iPhone. Samsung pictures still look clearly warmer.</p> 
            <p>During the day, the iPhone often goes for a brighter exposure, and we find the Galaxy to be a bit more true to life in this case. Both images have a solid amount of detail and beautiful colors, so no complaints.</p>
            <p>The other big battle is for video quality, where the iPhone was the leader. But now night video is improved on the Galaxy and the footage has less noise, plus you can use the 5X zoom camera also at night.What Samsung does have is 8K video recording, an option missing on the iPhone, but we are not sure many people really care about that considering the huge size associated with 8K video and the lack of support on most monitors and TVs.</p>
            <h2 class="title2">Performance and Software</h2>
            <img src="Images/S24vs15promax_software_comp.jpeg" alt="">
            <p>When it comes to performance, the battle is getting heated. Apple's new A17 Pro chip, the world's first based on a 3nm process, has not quite lived up to the huge hype, and then on the other hand, the Galaxy S24 Ultra is coming with a new Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip inside, which should hit a nearly perfect balance between increased performance and improved power efficiency.</p>
            <p>In terms of configurations, you have the same choice for the Galaxy and iPhone: 256GB, 512GB or 1TB of storage. The Galaxy comes with 12GB of RAM, while the iPhone comes with 8GB of RAM.However, the big difference is in the actual software: the Galaxy runs on Samsung's One UI 6.1 software on top of Android 14, while the iPhone runs on iOS 17.Samsung's new "Galaxy AI" is the big focus, while Apple seems to be late to the AI game (expect a big iOS 18 update this fall with a bunch of new AI features).</p>
            <p>We are also super stoked about having SEVEN YEARS of OS upgrades and security patches on the Galaxy, a first for Samsung. That beats even Apple which does not commit to a particular number, but typically provides 5 or 6 OS upgrades. One difference here, however, is that Samsung typically delivers those updates a few months later than their official release date.</p>
            <p>One interesting tidbit that Apple has included in recent iPhones is satellite connectivity, but there is none of that on the S24 series.Another detail worth knowing is that iPhone models in the United States (and only in the US) come with eSIM and NO physical SIM card slot. The Galaxy is less restrictive: it supports eSIM, but it also allows you to use a physical SIM card.</p>
            <h2 class="title2">Battery Life and Charging</h2>
            <img src="Images/S24vs15promax_battery_comp.jpeg" alt="">
            <p>With a 5,000 mAh battery size, the Galaxy has the theoretical advantage over the iPhone 15 Pro Max with its 4,422 mAh battery. That's a difference of 13% in favor of the Samsung phone.However, that's not how battery life works in real life.</p>
            <p>Our lighter web browsing test, shows these two last a similar amount of time with lighter use cases, but when you look at the YouTube video test, the iPhone outlasts the Galaxy by a good margin.When it comes to charging, the Galaxy is faster at speeds of 45W, compared to around 25W on the iPhone. This means you have to wait around 1 hour and 40 minutes for a full charge for the iPhone, while the Galaxy tops up in just around 1 hour.</p>
            <p>Both also support wireless charging at similar 15W speeds, but the iPhone also comes with the magnetic MagSafe support. The Galaxy does NOT support the new magnetic Qi2 standard.

            <img src="Images/S24vs15promax_final_comp.jpeg" alt="">
            <p>In summary, the Galaxy introduces a few neat improvements with AI, and it gives us small improvements all around. Of these, most noticeable might be the improved camera experience. It is also the bigger phone, it has the S Pen for those who care, and the customization and openness of Android.</p>
            <p>The iPhone, on the other hand, offers iOS and all the benefits of the Apple ecosystem, and it is also expected to have the slightly longer battery life. It can stand its ground with the 5X zoom camera, and it offers a number of Pro photo and video features that some will appreciate. </p>
            <p>Price-wise, the Galaxy is just slightly more expensive ($1300 for the base Galaxy vs $1200 for the iPhone), but Samsung phones are known to go on sale quite often, which is rarely the case for iPhone.So at the end of the day… which team are you on in 2024, team Apple or team Galaxy? And why? </p>
