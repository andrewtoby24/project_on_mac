            <h2>Google Pixel 8a Intro</h2>
            <p>Even since Google introduced the first Pixel A-series model back in 2019, the line has become the go-to option for those who want a budget phone with all the software bells and whistles Google has to offer.</p>
            <p>The series has enjoyed tremendous success to this day, and this holds true for the newly launched Pixel 8a. The phone landed on May 7th, after a surprising early move by Google, and it's poised to give all midrangers a serious run for their money.</p>
            <p>This phone has a lot going on for it. From the 120Hz screen and the last generation Tensor G3 chipset to Google's almighty Gemini AI available at a press of a button. Some might even say that Google shot itself in the leg with the Pixel 8a, making the regular Pixel 8 a tough sell. Well, it's time to find out!</p>
            <h2 class="title2">Redmi Note 13 5G Design & Display</h2>
            <img src="Images/GP8aDesign&Display.jpeg" alt="">
            <p>Right off the bat, we start with the obvious drawback of this phone. There are huge bezels around the screen, and when you turn the phone on, it's like looking back in time. Not that the Pixel 8a looks bad or something.</p>
            <p>Actually, the Bay color variant looks very fresh and poppy; I wouldn't mind this color on more gadgets. The phone feels very rounded. The frame of the Pixel 8a is not flat; it has a radius, and there's also a slight curvature on the back glass.</p>
            <p>Overall, the phone feels great in the hand, with the small exception that you can feel the part where the frame meets the back glass. Speaking of the back glass, it has a nice, matte finish with a papery feel when you run your fingers over it. It also fends off fingerprints really well.
            </p>
            <p>Time to check out the bezel-heavy display (seriously, it's a 3.5mm bezel with a half-centimeter chin). Well, what do you know. Despite the bezel situation, the display is actually really good. It's a 6.1-inch OLED with a FHD+ resolution (2400 x 1080 pixels), which translates to around 431 PPI, pretty decent for a midranger.</p>
            <p>The display is a 120Hz panel and can switch automatically between 60Hz and 120Hz. One thing worth mentioning is that you can't force 120Hz on the Pixel 8a all the time. There's a Smooth Display option that, when toggled, lets the phone choose when to bump up the screen refresh rate to 120Hz, and when to keep it at 60Hz.</p>
            <h2 class="title2">Google Pixel 8a Display Measurements</h2>
            <img src="Images/GP8aDisplay.jpeg" alt="">
            <p>When it comes to display tests, the Pixel 8a comes on top of all its direct competitors, including the regular Pixel 8. The screen is very bright; we measured almost 1,500 nits; the color accuracy is great; and the minimum brightness is also excellent. Overall, with the Pixel 8a, you're getting a flagship-grade screen in a midrange-priced phone. Minus the huge bezels, of course.</p>
            <p>Let's add a few words on biometrics here. The under-display fingerprint scanner is actually pretty fast and accurate. Google had some gremlins under the hood of some Pixel phones in the past, but they've been taken care of. The facial recognition also works pretty fast and consistently.</p>
            <h2 class="title2">Google Pixel 8a Camera</h2>
            <img src="Images/GP8aCamera.jpeg" alt="">
            <p>Our composite camera score takes into account various key aspects of the Pixel 8a camera's performance, such as exposure, focus, color reproduction, zoom quality, etc. Looking at the score above, it's clear to see that the Pixel 8a has a pretty decent main camera and ultrawide camera, but it's let down by the lack of a dedicated zoom lens.</p>
            <p>The Pixel 8a features the same camera system as its predecessor, namely a 64 MP main camera with OIS and f/1.89 aperture, coupled with a 13 MP ultrawide. This might disappoint some people, but don't forget how strong and advanced Google is when it comes to image processing algorithms.</p>
            <p>The selfie camera has also been carried over from the last modelâ€”it's a 13 MP, f/2.2, 20mm equivalent ultrawide snapper. On the software side of things, some of the features that are now available on the Pixel 8a are: Top Shot, Magic Editor, and Audio Magic Eraser, along with other tried and tested tools such as Magic Eraser, Night Sight, and Photo Unblur. The Pixel 8a doesn't feature a telephoto camera, but again, thanks to the clever software, we have Super Res zoom with up to 8x magnification.</p>
            <p>The shots from the main camera look pretty decent. I took the time to put them side-by-side with samples from the Pixel 7a and Pixel 8. The Pixel 8a definitely produces better images than its predecessor, and in good lighting conditions, the samples are comparable to those shot with the regular Pixel 8.</p>
            <p>The overall quality is very good across different scenarios. Portrait shots are pretty convincing, and ultrawide shots are also decent, although they don't seem to have the same detail as the samples from the main camera.</p>
            <h2 class="title2">Google Pixel 8a Battery & Test Results</h2>
            <img src="Images/GP8aCharging.jpeg" alt="">
            <p>The Pixel 8a features a 4,492 mAh battery, a clear upgrade compared to its predecessor. Funnily enough, in our battery tests, the Pixel 7a managed better results in web browsing and video streaming, while the Pixel 8a won the gaming battle (beating the Pixel 8 as well).</p>
            <p>I can't put my finger on it, but it's probably the screen, coupled with the Tensor G3, responsible for the battery performance. It's not that bad; the overall performance is close to the competition in this price range, and in day-to-day real-life use, the phone manages a full day with no problems.</p>
            <p>Charging is where things get problematic. The Pixel 8a comes with the same 18W wired charging (I can't use the word "fast" next to this kind of wattage) as its predecessor, and in 2024 it feels rather slow. I kinda hoped for Pixel 8 charging speeds, at least, but no cigar. The phone takes almost two hours to charge from 0 to 100%.</p>
            <h2 class="title2">Google Pixel 8a Software</h2>
            <img src="Images/GP8aSoftware.jpeg" alt="">
            <p>This is where things get really interesting. The smartphone world is heavy on AI these days; it's all the rage. All big companies are trying to implement AI in some shape or form, and Google is no exception. Gemini is onboard, and it's somewhat interconnected with Google Assistant.</p>
            <p>When you long-press the power button, the Pixel 8a wakes up Gemini. You can type, use your voice to talk to the Large Language Model, or upload a picture and show it to the AI. What's interesting is that Gemini also wakes up when you say "Hey, Google" or "Ok, Google," and if it can't accomplish the task given, it automatically hands it over to Google Assistant.</p>
            <p>For all intents and purposes, these two look and feel like the same thing. If you ask the phone to set an alarm or call someone, it will use Google Assistant to do so. But if you just ask a question, the phone will use Gemini.</p>
            <p>Gemini can't control apps directly (yet), and it can't transcribe and translate in real time; you need to use Google Translate for that. As of now, Gemini is not fully integrated with Google's own ecosystem of apps, but it's definitely coming in a Feature Drop or two. I can see Gemini doing things like composing and sending emails, texting people, transcribing meetings, controlling your smart home appliances, and so on.</p>
            <p>The Pixel 8a comes with seven years of major OS updates, Feature drops, and security patches, so the phone will be supported until 2031. Which is crazy if you think about it, especially if you compare it to flagship phones that cost three times as much, and offer just three of four years of software support.</p>
            <h2 class="title2">Summary</h2>
            <img src="Images/GP8aBuy:.jpeg" alt="">
            <p>The ultimate question! Google is committed to this tick-tock cycle where we get a midrange A-series phone every spring and a flagship duo in autumn. I'm not sure I can justify the existence of either the Pixel 8a or the Pixel 8 anymore. These two are so close that the $499 Pixel 8a immediately makes the $699 flagship obsolete, if you're shopping for Pixels right now.</p>
            <p>Now, taken out of this specific context, the Pixel 8a is a great midrange phone and a great bang for your buck. If you're looking for software longevity coupled with some great flagship-grade specs, it's a no-brainer. At $499, you can't go wrong with it, and as we all know, Pixel phones get better with each Feature drop. And there are plenty of those to come.</p>
            <p>On the other side of the "pros-cons" spectrum, there are some things that you should know, accept, and prepare to live with if you do buy this phone. You're going to look at those bezels all day, every day, so if it bothers you, walk away. They won't disappear with time. The charging is painfully slow, so better adjust your habits to charge overnight.</p>
            <p>That being said, the Pixel 8a offers a robust and future-proof software experience with many AI tricks yet to come, a great screen, and a quite decent main camera. And all that at a very competitive price.
